A next js 13 app.

An app where users can submit details of a car crash, the drivers involved in the accident can answer a number of questions to be matched with the reporter.
The original submitter can specify the level of detail needed in order to match together and communicate.

This project is mainly designed to learn the ins and outs of the new version of next js

This current version is mostly static, but there is setup in here that communicates with external APIs.
I would recommed checking out the components/submit-details/main-form files, along with the providers and services folders and the app directory ðŸš€
